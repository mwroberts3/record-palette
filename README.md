Record Palette is an alternative way to view your Discogs collection. The images and data are supplied by the Discogs API.

## Usage

Users enters their username and a folder ID (this can be left blank) when visiting the web app for the first time.

After their collection information is loaded all the album covers from their collection are displayed.

There are a few different display options at the top that let users choose how the albums are sorted, the size of images and whether to display a caption underneath the image.

Users can download the album covers with the download button, if they want to use the images for their own projects. (FEATURE ONLY AVAILABLE ON PCs).
