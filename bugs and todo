BUGS & FIXES:
-for some reason a typing cursor appears next to the logged in name, right at the end

-really strange glitch regarding popup image size. When my Pixel 2 is in the portrait position and I click a thumbnail from the top row, the image of the album cover is slightly larger than the popup container and pokes out on the bottom. 
    -this isn't an issue for all the images and if you scroll down a little while the popup is open, or choose an image from a lower row then this issue doesn't happen

-apostrophes and periods shouldn't count as the first "letter" when sorting by album

-need to account for the discogs fill-in spacer.gif, it kind of breaks the sort by color option

CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.15:
-username links to their discogs profile
-popup that displays album information when you click on the image from the gallery
-smoother transitions

FEATURES TO ADD:
-maybe add links to certain discogs pages when popup window is launched
-going off date added, maybe there should be a feature to see how fast their record collection is growing...sort of graph of the dates when their record collection started and how often they've added to it

-maybe should have two different sorting methods regarding release date. Could have release year for that specific version, and then maybe a year recorded method of sorting
