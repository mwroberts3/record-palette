BUGS & FIXES:
-make the customer <select> styling visible on a Mac by adding the following to its style in main.scss:
  appearance: none;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: none;


FEATURES TO ADD:
-going off date added, maybe there should be a feature to see how fast their record collection is growing...sort of graph of the dates when their record collection started and how often they've added to it

-maybe should have two different sorting methods regarding release date. Could have release year for that specific version, and then maybe a year recorded method of sorting

-clicking on cover should pull up popup with more information. Maybe can use the path.find method from 20 vanilla javascript section 8, mealfinder
