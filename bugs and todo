BUGS & FIXES:
-maybe add links to certain discogs pages when popup window is launched

-for some reason a typing cursor appears next to the logged in name, right at the end

CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.XX:
-username links to their discogs profile
-popup that displays album information when you click on the image from the gallery

FEATURES TO ADD:
-going off date added, maybe there should be a feature to see how fast their record collection is growing...sort of graph of the dates when their record collection started and how often they've added to it

-maybe should have two different sorting methods regarding release date. Could have release year for that specific version, and then maybe a year recorded method of sorting
